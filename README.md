# Movie Tickets Coding Kata

It's your first day of work at your local movie theater and you've already got a crisis
on your hands. The theater recently upgraded all of the point of sale terminals to a 
new cloud-based solution from Congo Web Services (CWS), but now CWS has gone offline and 
none of your coworkers are able to do the math required to sell movie tickets.

You figure out that the fancy internet-enabled popcorn machine is running Java, so you grab
the theater ticket pricing menu and get to work building your own cash register. Your 
popcorn-powered cash register will need to calculate the total purchase price for each 
customer, and you'll need to work quickly... the line outside is growing!

| Children (under 13)                                                      |      $5.50 |
| Group (20 people or more)                                                | $6.00 each |

| Exceptions*                               |        |
| ----------------------------------------- | -----: |
| 3D movie                                  | +$3.00 |
| Over-length (more than 120 min.)          | +$1.50 |
| Movie Day (Thursday, except for groups!)  | -$2.00 |
| Weekends                                  | +$1.50 |
| Loge                                      | +$2.00 |

_*Exceptions are applied for each ticket purchased._

**Customer satisfaction is important, so always charge the lowest possible price!**

##### Truths You Can Assume:
* Each customer can purchase any number of tickets, but all the tickets for that customer 
will always be for the same movie.
* A student can be any age (you're never too old to learn!)
* There are no age requirements for any of the movies (this is a family-friendly theater!)
* There are infinite seats available for all movies, so nothing is ever sold out.
* Customers must have at least 20 people physically present to qualify for the group rate (ex: 19 people cannot purchase 20 tickets just to get the cheaper total price)
